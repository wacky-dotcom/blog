    <div> <p font-family="PinkBunny">Welcome to my digital space on the net. This site is a reaction to both urban and digital gentrification. The consolidation of our physical and virtual worlds impedes self-expression. I made this shabby site to join the movement of people who're trying to reclaim space in the digital world. I've wanted to make a website for a while, but sometime in 2024 I became dissatisfied with the way popular social media platforms constrain self expression to better serve business goals. Living in an area of Detroit that's become gentrified, which is obvious through a growing night-time economy and major hotel firms purchasing residential buildings (like the one in the middle of the page), can be crushing. Besides soaring rent prices, Midtown's a pit of despair--the cross road for people escaping their abusive, dehumanizing, jobs and lives. </p>   
        <p font-family="PinkBunny">With that being noted, I hope to use this site as a platform to express myself. I don't have too much to say, but this is MY!! space >:D  -love MoCi </p>
